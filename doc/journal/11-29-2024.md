I just posted a topic on Reddit, asking for some advice. I have tried to create a barebones version of the data from 2024, and I am going to do some testing with it tonight. I removed some of the columns that are not used by Baseball Savant anymore, or are otherwise not worth keeping in the dataset. Removing some of the columns brought the file size from 402 MB, down to 356 MB. That's a pretty good chunk taken out of the file size, and that should make the training process go more smoothly.
