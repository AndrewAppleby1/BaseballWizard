I am trying to figure out how to get this algorithm to make sense, take into account everything that we need to, and make decisions based on the data we have. Until now, the algorithm has evaluated "home" and "away" as if they are actually teams, rather than evaluating the actual teams. I am trying to figure out how to make use of the vast set of data we have, and my idea is starting to make sense to me.

The most concise way of explaining the way the algorithm should work is that we are trying to predict the outcome of games, based on data that is record on a pitch-by-pitch basis. With that in mind, we know that the floor is the pitch-by-pitch data, and the ceiling is the outcome of the game. Therefore, we need to determine the steps between the floor and the ceiling, then we need to determine how each step is evaluated.

The game's outcome is the top. From there, we have two branches: offense, and defense. I need to figure out how to get down to the pitch-by-pitch data. I will work on it. Happy Thanksgiving!
