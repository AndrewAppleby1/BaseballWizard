# TODO
Less of a TODO list, more of a list of things that come to mind that could be cool to add.

1. General optimization
	- Make use of PySpark's functionality, and not just the basic stuff.
	- Introduce a logging system, provide more feedback to the user.

2. A GUI frontend
3. An easy way to set everything up on a new system
4. More detailed documentation
	- How about documentation that can be read without going through each bit of the code?
5. The Dream (tm)
	- An interactive baseball simulation, playable from the terminal (maybe a GUI, but later)
	- ASCII version of the field.
	- Peanuts, peanuts for all.

6. Create a template for reporting tests
	- Perhaps we could introduce an auto-reporting feature.

7. Provide a developer log

8. Improvements to the algorithm:
	- Improve the accuracy
	- Make the Mets lose all the time (accuracy)



## Misc:
- Organize data by games
	- If teams match
	- If date matches
	- It should be grouped
