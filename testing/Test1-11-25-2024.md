# Test 1 - 11/25/2024
Using the basic version of the algorithm, and data from Statcast, the model's statistics were as follows:

## Raw Output
Model Accuracy: 0.6990299568988567                                              
Feature Importances: (6,[0,1,2,3,4,5],[0.23719691068411375,0.26377313559341076,8.638104208607681e-05,0.00027888226113027175,0.45574919632670785,0.04291549409255129])


## Explanation
### Accuracy
- Accuracy was around 69.9%, as in, accuracy of predicting the outcomes of games.

### Feature Importance
Of the six (6) available features:
- (0) - home_team_index: 23.72%
- (1) - away_team_index: 26.38%
- (2) - home_avg_hits: 0.0086%
- (3) - away_avg_hits: 0.028%
- (4) - home_strikeouts: 45.57%
- (5) - away_strikeouts: 4.29%


## Notes
- For some reason, the home team's performance is significantly more impactful on the prediction than the performance of the away team. Why? Would adjusting the weighting improve the accuracy?
- Strikeouts are more valuable than hits, and by a lot. For the home team, average hits account for 0.0086% of the prediction process, while their strikeouts are responsible for 45.57% of the process, making it nearly twice as important as the second most important factor.
- Would data from previous years, improve the accuracy of the model?
- Would introducing data from years before 2023 improve the model's accuracy?
- Would introducing data from 2024 improve the model's accuracy?
- Would introducing additional features improve the accuracy of the model?
