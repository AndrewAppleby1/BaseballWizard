# Test 3 - 11/25/2024

Set driver memory to 4GB, and executor memory to 8GB. This delayed the messages about running out of memory to cache the data, but they appeared before too long.

This used data from 2015-2024, but not that well.

Model Accuracy: 0.6146695734273365                                              
Feature Importances: (6,[0,1,2,3,4,5],[0.09598809932482233,0.11821800813920022,0.02853452037676319,0.01766684859921697,0.6612011054742931,0.07839141808570423])


## Notes
- We should increase the number of features. 61% accuracy is ridiculous, considering how much data it has access to.
