This directory contains folders, organizing data by source. The algorithm requires a lot of work, and we want the work to be worth it, so we are exploring different datasets, in order to determine which is most useful to us.

# Sources
1. Kaggle - Not started
2. Statcast - Working version, not finished
3. Retrosheet - Studying documentation, working on initial version
